Tomatoes are a major crop in India, crucial for food security and local economies. Tomato plants are highly susceptible to multiple leaf diseases, including Early Blight, Late Blight, and Leaf Mold, which significantly reduce yield if not detected early. Traditional visual inspection is time-consuming, requires expert knowledge, and is inaccessible to many smallholder farmers, especially in rural areas.

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have enabled automated disease detection from leaf images with high accuracy. However, most existing solutions are limited to disease classification without transparency, making it difficult for farmers to trust or act on AI predictions. Furthermore, language barriers prevent many farmers from accessing advisory services effectively.

This research proposes a multimodal AI approach combining CNN-based disease detection, Explainable AI (Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP) for visual interpretability, and a multilingual chatbot (Tamil + English) that provides actionable organic and chemical treatment recommendations. By integrating image-based prediction with interactive advisory, this project aims to enhance trust, usability, and real-world impact of AI for sustainable tomato farming.
